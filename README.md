# Identification of PD-(D/E)XK nucleases

This repository contains the legacy code for a webserver previously published for the identification of PD-(D/E)XK nucleases and their homologs. The code was originally developed to facilitate the computational detection and classification of these families based on sequence data. Please note that this code is no longer maintained and is provided as-is for archival purposes.

For details on the methodology and results, please refer to the original publication:
