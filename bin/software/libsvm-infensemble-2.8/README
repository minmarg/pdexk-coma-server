The program introduces four new kernels to the LIBSVM
package. They are stump kernel, perceptron kernel, Laplacian
kernel, and exponential kernel. They are all for infinite
ensemble learning. Details can be found in

H.-T. Lin, Infinite Ensemble Learning with Support Vector Machines,
Master's Thesis, California Institute of Technology, 2005.

Usage:

1. make the binary by typing make.

2. use svm-train -t 4 (or 5, 6, 7) for the new kernels. (type
svm-train for usage)
